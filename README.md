# CVE-2021-27965
 Proof of concept for CVE-2021-27965 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow)

NOTE: I probably will not update this any further (there is still a chance I will finish it). I currently have the ability to cleanly overwrite the instruction pointer, but I believe that this is enough to prove I have the skill required to at least exploit a easy, but real-world kernel device driver. I will research the other CVE-2021-27965 exploit on tips on fixing this.
