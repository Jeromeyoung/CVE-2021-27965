# CVE-2021-27965
 Proof of concept for CVE-2021-27965 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow)

NOTE: I probably will not update this any further (there is still a chance I will finish it). I currently have the ability to cleanly overwrite the instruction pointer, but I believe that this is enough to prove I have the skill required to at least exploit a easy, but real-world kernel device driver. I will research the other CVE-2021-27965 exploit on tips on fixing this.

The reason why I didn't finish it? I have to use a specific token-stealing shellcode to prevent crashing, which would require me to re-write most of the exploit (which, I do not want to do).
